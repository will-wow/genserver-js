# genserver-js

A JavaScript implementation of Elixir GenServers, for building intuition. This definitely shouldn't be used in any serious code.

## Prerequisites

- Node 8.11.3
- Yarn 1.9.4

## Quick start

Install dependencies:

```
yarn install
```

## Task reference

- **`yarn test`** runs tests in "watch" mode, automatically focusing on tests or code that were modified since the last commit. Press the `a` key after the test runner has started to watch all tests in the project.
- **`yarn test:coverage`** runs all tests, prints coverage stats, and then exits.
- **`yarn format`** runs all code formatters
